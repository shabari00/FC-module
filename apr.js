/*
area and perimeter of rectangle -- Classes Practice Problems
Design a class which has 2 methods. One which computes the Area of the Rectangle. The other computes the Perimeter of the Rectangle. You should be able to pass the length l and width w while creating the object for the class. For all infeasible values of length l and width w, print area and perimeter as 0

Your class should be named as Rectangle. Method to get area should be named as rectangle_area. Method to get perimeter should be named as rectangle_perimeter.

Input
First line contains an integer for the length l Second line contains an integer for the width w

Output
Two lines containing integers. First line containing the Area of the Rectangle Second line containing the Perimeter of the Rectangle

Example
Input:

3
2
Output:

6
10
First line is 3 representing the length. Second line is 2 representing the width. Area is 3*2 which is 6 as represented in the first line of the output. Perimeter is 2*(3 + 2) which is 10 as represented in the second line of the output.
