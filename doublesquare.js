/*
Double Square
Write a function doubleOrSquare, which takes an integer as its argument. If the argument is positive, it should return twice its value, otherwise it should return its square.

You don't need to worry about taking input or printing output. Given template will take care of it. You only have to implement the function doubleOrSquare.

Example
Input: 5

Output: 10

Input: -5

Output: 25
